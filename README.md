Install the keyboard with "pip install keyboard del requiremnts"

Import the keyboard that will record all keyboard input. Create the function in charge of saving keyboard input with the event parameter, which will save whatever is happening at that moment. Then, create the file where what we saved with the keyboard is stored using open("we give it the name we give it"), ("what is done in the file, in this case the append function to save what is already there and not overwrite or delete it) as a file. Then, save what we receive in the file with file.write(the event. what was saved (name)). Assign what we saved to keyboard.on_press (function to write the file). Print the message if we want, and exit keyboard.wait(what we want to finish).
